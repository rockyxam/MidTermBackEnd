2. A book item contains the following properties 

  * Author

  * Call number
  * Publisher
  * Year of publication
  * Current status
  * Keywords


3. A librarian is able add, update, and delete books.
  * Update and deletion works together with search, i.e., a librarian has the capability to find a book through search, then decide to update/delete it.
  * A book cannot be deleted if itâ€™s checked out by a patron.
  * Deleting a book also removes the waiting list for it, if there is any.
